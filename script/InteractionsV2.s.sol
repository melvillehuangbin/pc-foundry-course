Notes

1. create a FundFundMe contract and WithdrawFundMe contract
2. forge install Cyfrin/foundry-devops
    - provides us with a tool for foundry to get most recently deployed contract
    - set ffi = true in foundry.toml file
        - WARNING: lets foundry run commands on cli
3. forge script {path to script}:{ContractName} to pick the contract to run
