**Prompt**

Using the below code snippet, create the question in a manner where it explains what each function should do. Include hints for each questions asked.

**Question:**

Consider the `PriceConverter` library in Solidity, which is designed to interact with a price feed to convert Ether amounts to their USD equivalent. The library includes several key functions and features.

1. **getPrice Function:**
   - What does the `getPrice` function do within the `PriceConverter` library?
   - Hint: The `getPrice` function retrieves the latest price of Ether in USD from a specified price feed address. It uses the `AggregatorV3Interface` to interact with the price feed and returns the price multiplied by 1e10 to adjust for the decimal places.

2. **getConversionRate Function:**
   - Explain the purpose and functionality of the `getConversionRate` function. How does it convert an amount of Ether to its USD equivalent?
   - Hint: The `getConversionRate` function takes an amount of Ether in wei as input and returns its equivalent value in USD. It first retrieves the current price of Ether in USD using the `getPrice` function and then calculates the conversion rate by multiplying the Ether amount by the Ether price in USD.

3. **getVersion Function:**
   - Describe the role of the `getVersion` function. What information does it provide?
   - Hint: The `getVersion` function retrieves the version of the `AggregatorV3Interface` from the specified price feed address. This can be useful for ensuring compatibility or for debugging purposes.

4. **Using Libraries in Solidity:**
   - How does the `using PriceConverter for uint256;` statement work in Solidity? What does it enable?
   - Hint: The `using` keyword in Solidity is used to attach library functions to a specific data type, in this case, `uint256`. This allows the functions defined in the `PriceConverter` library to be called on `uint256` variables as if they were methods of the `uint256` type, enhancing code readability and reusability.

5. **Library Interaction with External Contracts:**
   - How does the `PriceConverter` library interact with the `AggregatorV3Interface` contract? What is the significance of the `Interface(address)` statement?
   - Hint: The `PriceConverter` library interacts with the `AggregatorV3Interface` contract by creating an instance of the interface at a specific address. This allows the library to call functions defined in the `AggregatorV3Interface` contract, such as `latestRoundData` and `version`, to retrieve price data and version information.

6. **Benefits of Using Libraries:**
   - What are the benefits of using libraries in Solidity, as demonstrated by the `PriceConverter` library?
   - Hint: Libraries in Solidity are beneficial because they allow for reusable code, which can reduce gas costs and improve code organization. They are stateless and cannot be destroyed, making them ideal for functions that do not modify the state of the contract.
